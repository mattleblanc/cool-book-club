  The world is filled with so many books that often it is hard to choose. I find it fascinating how our choice in books relates to our development and thought
  processes. But as my friend Sam would point out, "This is a chicken and the egg problem". Is it our thought process that push us to like certain books? Or
  do the books we have choosen to read change our thought patterns? I think it is a bit of both and in the year 2021, I will give the users of this webpage 
  unique personal insight into my choices on books and my thoughts surrounding them.

  My Background: I am a studying to be a scientist and have no degrees in literature. In fact, I provide a very unique literary insight that has puzzled many
  of English teachers. To help the inquisitive website viewer understand my perspective: My favorite genre's are Magical Realism and Sports Biographies; 
  My all time favorite author is Isabel Allende; My favorite book is "The House of the Spirits". Now, in the words of one of my favorite literature teachers: 
  "Brendan, stop pussy footing around and get to the point!". LET'S READ SOME BOOKS

     Review: Many of my friends have raved about this book and the conclusion of this trilogy, so it was absolutely necessary that I finally get around to finishing it.
     There are several different story lines that this book jumps between, much like some of my favorite Star Wars books. My favorite story line was by far that of Mary
     Malone, a scientist who finds herself in a strange place. I thought the book was very creative and rates highly as book for childern and young adults, however there
     were many story lines that I didn't enjoy very much. In particular, that of Lyra. I really wanted more from her as a character, I felt that she depended too much
     on one of the male characters. But this is just me, I enjoy female characters who are bold, adventurous, and independent. Often, I find that male authors struggle 
     with this. However, credit where credit is due, Mary Malone was fantastic and really makes the whole book for me.

     Review: Fantastic read! I would recommend this book to anyone that is doing a bit of soul searching. In this biography, the author tells the story of his hero, 
     extreme skier Doug Coombs. The author does so with two storylines, one follows the life of Doug Coombs and the other follows the author's quest to ski in the 
     the tracks of Doug. Both storylines are incredibly engaging and the transitions between them are seamless. Throughout this book, the author changes in many 
     of the same ways that I have changed since moving to France. This book has made me think about how to "follow" my heros, how to enjoy the world around me, and 
     how to evaluate risks. I am going to think about this book for a very long time.
