  <h3>EP Vol. 2 -- Design Fiction</h3>

  <p>For the last four centuries, from the Renaissance onward, we have seen the emergence of different fields of knowledge -- biology, chemistry, linguistics, semiotics, and so on. All these fields are deeply related to the evolution of knowledge and have become a highly articulated economy. Under computationalism it is almost impossible to separate these fields. Chemistry, for example, has very little meaning -- a chemist is using a computer and doing computational chemistry just as a biologist is using a computer and doing computational biology. Everyone is using a computer. Therefore the most generic aspect of our time is the computer. [...] The intelligence coming from the machine is so important we cannot remove it. So it helps us to make more discoveries in these disciplines, and these disciplines in turn allow us to discover and produce new paradigms of computation.</p>

  <p>I did finish reading the last chapter of<i>The Design of Everyday Things</i>, does that count? Probably not. It was a book about bad doors and sinks, and how I am not wrong for thinking that they are bad.</p>
