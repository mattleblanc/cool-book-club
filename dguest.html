    <h1>Welcome to Dan's Homepage!!!'</h1>
    <p>I read a book about people living in <abbr title="like outer space!">space</abbr>. It's a few hundred years in the future. I think was believable.
      One of the main charicters thought giving everyone more information would make the world (well a few worlds) a better place.
      It was supposed to address a contemporary idea.
    </p>
    <p>I started reading another book about the same people, still living in space. It's pretty good.</p>
    <p>Now I'm reading "Bullshit Jobs". It's also pretty good.</p>
    <p>I also sometimes read articles. Here are some good ones:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/humanitys-high-hopes-for-our-robotic-offspring">Humanity's High Hopes for Our Robotic Offspring</a>: Slightly cynical take on the future of technology and what current technology has taught us about humanity. From 2010, but still relevant today.</li>
        <li>I read a really good one about why South Africa is a mess now (hint, it's the British again). I think it was <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/06/25/the-reputation-laundering-firm-that-ruined-its-own-reputation">in the New Yorker</a>, but I could be wrong (it's behind a paywall, have to double-check when I get around it</li>
        <li><a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/robot_armies.htm">Who will command the robot armies</a>: is actually a talk, generally about robots but touches on the idea that capitalism as a whole is far dumber than any one of its individual parts, and how robots in such a system are a fancy means toward incredibly stupid ends.</a>
      </ul>
