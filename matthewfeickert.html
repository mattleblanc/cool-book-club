   <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11667578-reinventing-discovery">Reinventing Discovery: The New Era of Networked Science</a> by Michael Nielsen</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Review on Goodreads: forthcoming</li>
     <li>
       While I write my review for <i>Reinventing Discovery</i> I'll note that it
       feels like a manifesto for my ideas on open science, and I found it interesting
       how many of the same points that Nielsen brought up in the book (published in 2012)
       on the problems that plauge science are still quite relevant today.
       I am biased towar'ds Nielsen's writings though as we share common goals for
       open science and Neilsen's book on machine learning was one of my first formal
       introductions to the subject.
       Conditioned on that, and my my work angled at producing more open and reproducible
       science it is perhaps not difficult to understand why this section in the final few
       pages of the book in Chapter 8 resonanted with me strongly:

      <blockquote>
        If you're a scientist who is also a programmer, you have a special role to play,
        an opportunity to build the new tools that redfine how science is done.
        Be bold in experimenting with new ideas: this is the golden age of scientific
        software.
        But also be bold in asserting the value of your work.
        Today, your work is likely to be undervalued by old-fashioned colleagues, not
        because of malice, but because of a lack of understanding.
        Explain to other scientists how they should cite your work.
        Work in cahoots with your scientist programmer friends to establish shared norms
        for citation, and for sharing of code.
        And then work together to gradually ratchet up the pressure on other scientists to
        follow those norms.
        Don't just promote your own work, but alo insist more broadly on the value of code
        as a scientific contribution in its own right, every bit as valuable as more traditional
        forms.
